# Building a Data Model for Retail Data

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive data model by establishing relationships between various retail data files. This foundational work will support future analysis and insights into sales trends and customer behavior.

## objectives
- **Integrate multiple datasets** into a coherent data model. 🔄
- **Define relationships** between different product categories for streamlined analysis. 📂
- **Prepare the data structure** for future analytical tasks. 🛠️

## **Methodology**  
### **1. Identify Fact and Dimension Tables**[       file](https://github.com/Susmita1703/Building-a-Data-Model-for-Retail-Data/blob/main/Fact%20and%20dimension%20Table%20details%20.pdf) 
- Analyze the datasets to classify tables into fact and dimension tables for a structured data model. 📊

### **2. Create Tables in SQL** 
- Utilize SQL to construct tables with appropriate relationships. Here is the [link to the SQL file](https://github.com/Susmita1703/Building-a-Data-Model-for-Retail-Data/blob/main/sql%20queries%20for%20proper%20creating%20tables.sql) containing the queries for table creation. 🗃️

### **3. Import Data into Power BI**  
- Import the structured tables from SQL into Power BI, enabling further data modeling and visualization. 📥

### **4. Develop Data Model in Power BI**[     file](https://github.com/Susmita1703/Building-a-Data-Model-for-Retail-Data/blob/main/data%20modeling%20project.pbix)
- Establish relationships between the tables within Power BI to create a cohesive data model. This model will serve as a foundation for future analysis and insights. 🔗💡
